		Creating a workinpoland.com site with laravel

	workinpoland.com is my first project using the laravel framework. To create a task implementation, I've activated Bootstrap, jQuery and phpQuery in addition to laravel.
	The project contains a header which, when scrollable, has several sections: carousel, vacancies, documents, contacts, reviews, feedback. Additional work with the database, from which we take content for the site.
	Also, when entering the url string http://workinpoland.com/pars_work, the donor parsing controller is activated and the result is displayed on the screen and recorded in the database. When re-accessing the site http://workinpoland.com/ we can see all the data available to us on vacancies. For ease of deployment of the project, migrations and data gathering are carried out to record the main content in the database.
